Hello world!

Trying to do another commit. 

After editing file, needed to "stage" the file using the command <git add filename.txt>.
Next, will "commit" the changes using <git commit -m 'note'>.

Let's see how this goes! 

Remember to use <git status> to see what's up as I go :)

Ok, trying another commit to make sure that I have a good handle on this process.
