Hello world!

Trying to do another commit. 

After editing file, needed to "stage" the file using the command <git add filename.txt>.
Next, will "commit" the changes using <git commit -m 'note'>.

Let's see how this goes! 

Remember to use <git status> to see what's up as I go :)

Ok, trying another commit to make sure that I have a good handle on this process.

This is me making a change in the new branch.

Now I'm editing using BBedit instead of vi in the command line.

In order to see all of the information about what changed with each commit, use the command <git log -p>
